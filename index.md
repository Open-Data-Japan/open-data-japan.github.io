## Our mission

The Japanese government (and other sites) offers a wealth of open data about Japan, its economy and people. 
However, this data is often difficult to use: Descriptions and column names are available only in Japanese, data comes in human-readable Excel reports (or worse: PDFs) and is not ready to be machine-read. 

We want to make this information more accessible and provide a curated list of sample analyses and data sets.

## Datasets

Each dataset is hosted in its own repository on GitHub and includes a sample analysis in the form of a jupyter notebook. The README file in each repository includes a description of the data and a data dictionary.

See below for list of all available datasets:

|  Title  |  Description  | Repository | Sample Analysis |   
| --- | --- |  --- |  --- |   --- |    
| Public holidays | A list of public holidays in Japan from 1955-2022 by year with Japanese and English names | [Data repository](https://github.com/Open-Data-Japan/odj-data-public_holidays) | [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/Open-Data-Japan/odj-data-public_holidays/blob/main/sample-analysis/jupyter-odj-data-public_holidays.ipynb) |
